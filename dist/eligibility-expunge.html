If you don't feel comfortable talking to the DA, call the <a href=http://www.reentryroundtable.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/UT-Law-Expunction-Project-Fall-2014-Flier.pdf>University of Texas Expunction Clinic</a> for consultation, or fill out their intake form <a href=https://utexas.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5p95bNQXoYjDrcp>here</a>.</p><p>To move forward with your expunction petition, <a href=http://texaslawhelp.org/resource/expunction-of-records-in-texas>download</a> and fill out two forms: Petition for Expunction of Criminal Records and Order Directing Expunction of Criminal Records.</p><p>Sign the forms in front of a Notary.</p><p>Go to Travis County District Clerk, located at 1000 Guadalupe St, Austin, TX 78701.
