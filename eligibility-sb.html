Or you may be eligible to have a misdemeanor or felony "non-disclosed" if the incident occurred after Sept. 1, 2015.The new law is complex, and in general does not apply to the following offenses (whether misdemeanor or felony level):</p><p>Murder</p><p>Kidnapping / unlawful restraint</p><p>Smuggling/Trafficking of persons</p><p>Sexual offenses including prostitution and pornography</p><p>Offenses against the family</p><p>Disorderly conduct</p><p>Any weapons charge</p><p>People who must register as sex offenders</p><p>Organized crime offences</p><p>That said, if:</p><p>this was your first offense;</p><p>it is not on the list above;</p><p>it was a misdemeanor;</p><p>you were given "deferred supervision," and</p><p>at least six months have passed since the date of your incident,</p><p>then you are likely eligible for a faster process for getting the crime expunged from your criminal record.</p><p>STEPS:</p><p>1. Get your case file from the Travis County Clerk.</p><p>2. Review your file. You are looking for a statement from the judge that either 'nondisclosure is not in the best interest of justice' one stating that the offense involved family violence. If either of these findings are in your file, you will not qualify for expidited expunction. You may still qualify for an order of nondisclosure but you should get assistance from an attorney.</p><p>3.
