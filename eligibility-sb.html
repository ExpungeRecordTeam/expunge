Or you may be eligible to have a misdemeanor or felony "non-disclosed" if the incident occurred after Sept. 1, 2015.The new law is complex, and in general does not apply to the following offenses (whether misdemeanor or felony level):</p><ul><li>Murder</li><li>Kidnapping / unlawful restraint</li><li>Smuggling/Trafficking of persons</li><li>Sexual offenses including prostitution and pornography</li><li>Offenses against the family</li><li>Disorderly conduct</li><li>Any weapons charge</li><li>People who must register as sex offenders</li><li>Organized crime offences</li></ul><p>That said, if:</p><ul><li>this was your first offense;</li><li>it is not on the list above;</li><li>it was a misdemeanor;</li><li>you were given "deferred supervision," and</li><li>at least six months have passed since the date of your incident,</li><li>then you are likely eligible for a faster process for getting the crime expunged from your criminal record.</li></ul><p>STEPS:</p><ol><li>Get your case file from the Travis County Clerk.</li><li>Review your file.
