There are many commands available to help you build and test sites. Here are a few highlights to get started with.

## Watch For Changes & Automatically Refresh Across Devices

```sh
$ npm start
```

This outputs an IP address you can use to locally test and another that can be used on devices connected to your network.

## Deploying

The project is hooked up to Travis CI and any push to master will build and publish the site to http://expungetexas.org/
