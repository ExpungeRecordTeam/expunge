  h2#welcome Start with a clean slate

  p You had a run-in with the criminal system. You may have a criminal record and it may be preventing you from bettering your life.

  p However, you can do something about it. We are part of <a href="http://www.open-austin.org/">Open Austin</a>, a civic initiative to address issues in Austin.
