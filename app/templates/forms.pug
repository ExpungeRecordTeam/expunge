    a(name="expunction" style='color: black;') Petition for Expunction

  p
    | How to get started: You will need to fill out two forms and file them with the county. But first, we recommend calling the Travis County District Attorney’s office and asking if they will oppose your Petition for expunction. The number is
    a(href="tel:1-512-854-9400") (512) 854-9400
    |. Have your charging papers from your original arrest handy. Ask for the name of the ADA in charge of your case. Ask if they will oppose your petition for expunction.

  p
    | If the answer is yes, you may need to wait to file until the
    a(href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/CR/htm/CR.12.htm") statute of limitation on your charge
    | has expired. If you don’t feel comfortable talking to the DA, call the
    a(href="http://www.reentryroundtable.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/UT-Law-Expunction-Project-Fall-2014-Flier.pdf") University of Texas Expunction Clinic
    | for consultation, or fill out their
    a(href="https://utexas.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5p95bNQXoYjDrcp") intake form
    | .

  p
    | To move forward with your expunction petition,
    a(href="http://texaslawhelp.org/resource/expunction-of-records-in-texas") download and fill out two forms
    | : Petition for Expunction of Criminal Records and Order Directing Expunction of Criminal Records.

  p Sign the forms in front of a Notary.

  p Go to Travis County District Clerk, located at 1000 Guadalupe St, Austin, TX 78701. File your Petition along with a copy of your order of dismissal or not guilty order. You will be charged a fee of $302.

  p
    | If you cannot afford the fee, you may request a
    a(href="http://traviscountyclerk.org/eclerk/content/images/pdf_tc_probate_AffIndigency_Nov2012.pdf") waiver
    | .

  p You must notify the District Attorney that you have filed your Petition for expunction. So, while you are at the courthouse, deliver a copy of your Petition to the Travis County District Attorney’s Office, located next door at 509 W. 11th street. Get a receipt showing you delivered it because you may need to prove that you gave the District Attorney notice.
