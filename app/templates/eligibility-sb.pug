  p You may be eligible to remove or hide your new criminal charge, thanks to recent changes in Texas law (SB 1902) <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/84R/billtext/html/SB01902F.htm">http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/84R/billtext/html/SB01902F.htm</a> giving more people the ability to expunge or get an order of "non-disclosure" for a first offense.If your FIRST OFFENSE incident occurred after September 1, 2015, and you were given deferred adjudiction, you may be eligible for a faster process of expungement than the law previously allowed. Or you may be eligible to have a misdemeanor or felony "non-disclosed" if the incident occurred after Sept. 1, 2015.The new law is complex, and in general does not apply to the following offenses (whether misdemeanor or felony level):

  ul
    li Murder
    li Kidnapping / unlawful restraint
    li Smuggling/Trafficking of persons
    li Sexual offenses including prostitution and pornography
    li Offenses against the family
    li Disorderly conduct
    li Any weapons charge
    li People who must register as sex offenders
    li Organized crime offences

  p That said, if:
  ul
    li this was your first offense;
    li it is not on the list above;
    li it was a misdemeanor;
    li you were given "deferred supervision," and
    li at least six months have passed since the date of your incident,
    li then you are likely eligible for a faster process for getting the crime expunged from your criminal record.

  p STEPS:
  ol
    li Get your case file from the Travis County Clerk.
    li Review your file. You are looking for a statement from the judge that either 'nondisclosure is not in the best interest of justice' one stating that the offense   involved family violence. If either of these findings are in your file, you will not  qualify for expidited expunction. You may still qualify for an order of nondisclosure but you should  get assistance from an attorney.
