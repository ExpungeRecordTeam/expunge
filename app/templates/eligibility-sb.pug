  p You may be eligible to remove or hide your new criminal charge, thanks to recent changes in Texas law (SB 1902) <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/84R/billtext/html/SB01902F.htm">http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/84R/billtext/html/SB01902F.htm</a> giving more people the ability to expunge or get an order of "non-disclosure" for a first offense.If your FIRST OFFENSE incident occurred after September 1, 2015, and you were given deferred adjudiction, you may be eligible for a faster process of expungement than the law previously allowed. Or you may be eligible to have a misdemeanor or felony "non-disclosed" if the incident occurred after Sept. 1, 2015.The new law is complex, and in general does not apply to the following offenses (whether misdemeanor or felony level):

  p Murder
  p Kidnapping / unlawful restraint
  p Smuggling/Trafficking of persons
  p Sexual offenses including prostitution and pornography
  p Offenses against the family
  p Disorderly conduct
  p Any weapons charge
  p People who must register as sex offenders
  p Organized crime offences

  p That said, if:
  p this was your first offense;
  p it is not on the list above;
  p it was a misdemeanor;
  p you were given "deferred supervision," and
  p at least six months have passed since the date of your incident,
  p then you are likely eligible for a faster process for getting the crime expunged from your criminal record.

  p STEPS:
  p 1. Get your case file from the Travis County Clerk.
  p 2. Review your file. You are looking for a statement from the judge that either 'nondisclosure is not in the best interest of justice' one stating that the offense   involved family violence. If either of these findings are in your file, you will not  qualify for expidited expunction. You may still qualify for an order of nondisclosure but you should  get assistance from an attorney.

  p 5. Bring it to the Travis County Clerk, located at 1000 Guadalupe St, Austin, TX 78701. You will need to pay a $28 fee.

  p 6. Check back in a few weeks to ensure that the Judge issued your order of expunction.Even if you agreed to a plea of guilty for your first offense, if you were granted community supervision and have completed that supervision with no additional charges since your incident, you may now be eligible to apply for an Order of Non-disclosure.Download the Petition for an Order of Non-disclosure here. <a href="http://www.txcourts.gov/media/524157/petition_for_order_of_nondisclosure_form.pdf">http://www.txcourts.gov/media/524157/petition_for_order_of_nondisclosure_form.pdf</a> Ask for assistance from the University of Texas Expungement Clinic here. <a href="https://law.utexas.edu/probono/projects/special-projects/texas-law-expunction-project/"> https://law.utexas.edu/probono/projects/special-projects/texas-law-expunction-project/</a>
